# 💼 Admin Panel
The admin panel (or workspace) is the place where you can create and manage your pages, apis, devices, etc. This panel is a Next.js app that runs on port `3000` by default, but with our Redbird proxy runs in `8080` port.

## 📚 Sidebar

This sections are the default ones, but you can add new ones or remove them if you want. See [extending Admin Panel](/adminpanel/extending) for more information.

## 📱 Section Preview
The section preview will show you the content of the section to manage it.

### 🧑‍💻 Users
Users section is the place where you can manage users, see their information, change their password, etc.

### 👥 Groups
Every user is part of a group. The groups are used to manage permissions in the system. For example, you can create a group called `manager` and give it permissions to manage the whole system. Let's see how to create a group. 

### 🧩 Objects
The objects section is the way to create domain related objects. For example, if you want to create a `message` object you can do it using the admin panel.

### 🔎 APIs
The APIs section allows to create Rest or Rest-like APIs for almost everything you want. You can select a default API type like `Automatic CRUD` and `IOT Router` or create your `own` type by using a custom template. 

### 📄 Pages

Pages can be website pages, mobile pages or desktop pages. It allows you to list, create, edit and delete the user facing pages in your system.

When creating a page, the following options are required:

  - **Name**: The name of the page. This will be used to create the file in the project.
  - **Route**: The route of the page on the web or app, like `/help` or `/downloads`.
  - **Template**: The template that will be used to create the page.
  - **Object**: Comming soon.
  - **Require user**: If the page requires admin user to be accessed. 
  - **Permissions**: Comming soon. 

The pages are created in the path `packages/app/bundles/custom/pages/pageName.tsx` of the project. This means that you can manually create a page without using the admin panel.
