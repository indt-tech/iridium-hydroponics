**WINDOWS PERFORMANCE**

Having the Real-time protection feature activated in Windows Defender may cause a downgrade in your experience, as this setting will scan every and each of your files while installing "yarn" on your repository. 
This feature is found under Settings > Privacy & security > Windows Security > Virus & threat protection > Manage settings

For a better experience, we recommend adding an exclusion to skip the folder where your repository can be found.
