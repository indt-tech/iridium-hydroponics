# 🗝️ How to access

## Access the system

By default if you are in `development` there is a proxy running on port `8080` that redirects to the **next.js** app on port `3000` and the **api** on port `3001` and the **admin-api** on port `3002`. You can go to `apps/proxy/index.ts` to change defaults or add more services like the expo app.

Once the Next.js app is running you can go to `http://localhost:8080` to see the web app. 

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

  If you have problems accessing the services, remember to check your firewall configuration.

## 🙋‍♂️ Adding a user
The first time you run the starter you won't have users. You can easily create one by registering throught the interface at `http://localhost:8080/auth/register`, but this one will be a normal user. 

If you want to create an admin user you can do it using CLI by running the following command:

```bash
yarn add-user user@email.com password admin
# yarn add-user [your-email] [your-password] [user-type]
```

Or if you started with **Docker**: 

```bash
cd docker
./add-user
```

We've just created a user with `admin` type!

## 🛠️ Building and Customizing your Project
The **admin panel** is the place that allow you to customize your aplication and services there you can create and manage your system entities, like pages, apis, devices, users, objects, etc...
