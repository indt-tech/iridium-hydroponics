# 🕹️ Automations
Once your electronics are assembled and your device/s has a definition loaded into it, you can start creating your custom automations.

To add a new automation, in the Workspace home menu, go to 'Development' > 'Automations', click the ➕​ symbol and select the 'Automation' template.

Here are some examples of typical automations for hydroponic systems.
