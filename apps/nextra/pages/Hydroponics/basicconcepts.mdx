# Hydroponics basic concepts
Before starting with your plantation, here are some basic hydroponics concepts you need to know. 
## ​🥬​​ Crop selection
<div>
Choose suitable varieties, some plants thrive better in hydroponic systems than others. Lettuces, herbs, and tomatoes are excellent choices for beginners.

## ​💧​​​ Water quality
<div>
Water quality can significantly impact plant growth, nutrient uptake, and overall system health. 

Reverse osmosis (RO) water is often considered the best choice for its purity, although it may require remineralization to support plant health. Tap water can contain chlorine, chloramines, and varying levels of dissolved minerals. Rainwater, while softer and potentially ideal, may not be available consistently. 

Water hardness, primarily determined by the concentrations of calcium and magnesium, affects nutrient availability. Hard water might lead to nutrient imbalances as it could supply excessive amounts of certain minerals. Soft water, while low in these minerals, may require supplementation to meet plant needs.

## ​🧪​ pH
<div>
pH level is crucial for the optimal absorption of nutrients by plants. It influences the solubility of nutrients and their availability to plant roots. 

Most hydroponic systems perform best within a pH range of 5.5 to 6.5. This range ensures maximum nutrient availability for a wide variety of plants. However, specific crops may have unique pH preferences.

Regularly check the pH of your nutrient solution. Proper pH control ensures that your plants are able to efficiently uptake nutrients, leading to healthier growth and higher yields. 

If the pH is outside the ideal range, use pH up (base) or pH down (acid) solutions to adjust it. Add these solutions sparingly, and retest the pH after each adjustment to avoid overshooting the target range.

Adding nutrients or fresh water to your system can alter the pH. Always recheck and adjust the pH after making changes to your nutrient solution.

Keep your hydroponic system clean to prevent organic matter from decomposing and affecting the pH.

Remember, stability is the key. Frequent, drastic changes in pH can stress plants, affecting their growth and development.

## ​🧂​ EC (Electrical conductivity)
<div>
EC measures the total dissolved salts in the water, an indicator of its overall mineral content. Too low EC means there are not enough nutrients available, while too high EC can lead to nutrient toxicity.

The optimal EC range also varies depending on the plant type and its growth stage.

Starting with water of low EC is recommended, as this allows more precise control over nutrient concentrations. 
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Always maintain the water level constant. Water evaporation and absorption by plants mean that EC measurements taken at different water levels may not be accurate. Regularly adjusting the water level is necessary to ensure reliable readings.

## ​🍴​​ Nutrients & NPK ratio
<div>
There are three main macronutrients that plants need and play crucial roles in various plant functions
<div>
* 🍃**Nitrogen (N)** is essential for leaf growth
* 🌸**Phosphorus (P)** for the development of roots, flowers, and fruits
* 💪**Potassium (K)** for overall plant health and resistance.
</div>
The ideal NPK ratio varies depending on the type of plant and its growth stage.

There are powdered and liquid options. Achieving a stable system with powdered nutrients is more challenging as they don't easily dissolve uniformly. Some components can take days to fully dissolve, significantly affecting nutrient concentration and pH measurements. Additionally, precipitates sometimes form, creating crystals at the bottom, leading to sudden nutrient drops and potential blockages in the system. 

Pre-diluted nutrients, specifically those that separate micro from macro nutrients, allow appropriate feeding configurations depending on the crop stage.
</div>

## 🌡️​​ Water temperature
<div>
The optimal water temperature for most hydroponic crops is between 18°C and 22°C. Temperatures outside this range can negatively affect nutrient absorption and plant growth. 
</div>

## 🔆​ Light intensity & duration
<div>
The amount of light and photoperiod (the duration of daily light exposure) required can vary significantly among different types of plants.
</div>

## ​🦠 Disease prevention
<div>
Preventing diseases in your hydroponic system is crucial for maintaining healthy plants and optimal growth. Incorporating beneficial bacteria and fungi, and adhering to hygienic practices significantly reduce the risk of pathogenic outbreaks.
