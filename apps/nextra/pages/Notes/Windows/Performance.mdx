# WINDOWS PERFORMANCE

***Remember**: You can check your performance in Task Manager under the 'Processes' tab.*

Having the 'Real-time protection' feature activated in Windows Defender may cause a downgrade in your experience. This setting scans each of your files while you are installing `yarn` on your repository. This feature can be found under `Settings > Privacy & security > Windows Security > Virus & threat protection > Manage settings`.

For a better experience, we recommend adding an exclusion to skip scanning the folder where your repository is located.
