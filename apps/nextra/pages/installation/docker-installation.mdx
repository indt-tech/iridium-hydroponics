### Docker Installation (more advanced)

To run the project using docker you don't need to have installed **NodeJS**. 
To run in docker you must have installed `docker` and `docker compose`.
Once installed, you can run Protofy in dev mode with the following commands:

```bash
cd docker
./start-dev
```

if you want to run it in background mode, use:

```bash
cd docker
./dev
```

To compile protofy in production mode using docker:

```bash
cd docker
./web-build
./start-prod
```
